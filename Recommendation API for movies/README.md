# Recommendation-API-for-movies
 Movie Recommendation API that can be used by anyone to provide relevant movie suggestions to their users in an app or a website.
 
 __Content-Based recommendation works on the principle that if a user likes a certain item then we recommend the user a similar item based on the item’s features or attributes. So in our case, if a user likes a movie of a particular genre or an actor then we recommend a movie on similar lines to our user. So, if a user has watched the movie Joker then our recommendation system would predict movies similar to Joker or with the same cast as that of Joker if we consider the movie’s cast.__
