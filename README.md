### What is a Recommendation Engine?
__A Recommendation system is an algorithm aimed at suggesting relevant data to a user based on past preferences or ratings given by the user or suggesting relevant data to a user based on the itemâ€™s attributes.__

### Objective Vision :
Recafilm is a movie recommendation program that utilizes user data to match and recommend
the user with movies and films that it thinks the user will enjoy. This will not be a streaming
service, but purely used for recommendations and suggestions based on the user and movie data.
The program will use a login system with personalized user accounts, as well as an API for its
movie database. The user will also be able to change or edit their movie preferences as they
choose, so that the program will suggest different movies based on the selections.
